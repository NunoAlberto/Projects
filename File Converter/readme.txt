- My fractal.sk, converted from the fractal.pgm, is 361kB.
- My converter.c program converts every .pgm file to .sk and from the resulting .sk file to .pgm, lossless.
- To convert .pgm to .sk, the .pgm file must be 200x200 and in the basic format.
- To convert .sk to .pgm, the file must be written in the same format as it is written in the program from a .pgm file.
- The conversion from .sk to .pgm can handle colours outside the grayscale.
